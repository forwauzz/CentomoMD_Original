# Phase 0 Testing Checklist

## Pre-Implementation Testing
- [ ] Current system works with all three modes
- [ ] WebSocket connection established successfully
- [ ] AWS Transcribe receives audio data
- [ ] All modes produce transcription results
- [ ] Authentication works (both enabled/disabled)

## Implementation Testing

### Frontend Changes
- [ ] Mode parameter added to start_transcription message
- [ ] All three modes send correct mode value
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality
- [ ] WebSocket connection still works

### Backend Changes
- [ ] getModeSpecificConfig function works correctly
- [ ] WebSocket handler receives mode parameter
- [ ] Mode-specific configuration generated
- [ ] TranscriptionService receives mode config
- [ ] AWS Transcribe gets correct parameters per mode

### Mode-Specific Testing

#### Word-for-Word Mode
- [ ] ShowSpeakerLabel: false
- [ ] PartialResultsStability: 'high'
- [ ] No VocabularyName set
- [ ] Transcription accuracy maintained
- [ ] Performance not degraded

#### Smart Dictation Mode  
- [ ] ShowSpeakerLabel: true
- [ ] PartialResultsStability: 'high'
- [ ] VocabularyName: 'medical_terms_fr' (when available)
- [ ] Speaker attribution working
- [ ] Medical terminology recognition improved

#### Ambient Mode
- [ ] ShowSpeakerLabel: true
- [ ] PartialResultsStability: 'medium'
- [ ] No VocabularyName set
- [ ] Speaker diarization working
- [ ] Natural conversation handling

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Mode switching during session works
- [ ] All modes work with minimal auth (AUTH_REQUIRED=false)
- [ ] All modes work with full auth (AUTH_REQUIRED=true)
- [ ] WebSocket reconnection works
- [ ] Session management works
- [ ] Error handling works

### Performance Testing
- [ ] No latency increase
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] No CPU usage increase
- [ ] Audio quality maintained
- [ ] Transcription accuracy maintained

### Backward Compatibility
- [ ] Existing sessions continue working
- [ ] Old frontend clients still work
- [ ] API endpoints unchanged
- [ ] Database schema unchanged
- [ ] Configuration files unchanged

## Post-Implementation Testing

### AWS Integration
- [ ] AWS Transcribe receives correct parameters per mode
- [ ] No AWS errors or warnings
- [ ] AWS costs not increased unexpectedly
- [ ] AWS logs show mode-specific configuration

### User Experience
- [ ] Mode selection works as expected
- [ ] Transcription quality improved per mode
- [ ] No user-facing errors
- [ ] Performance feels the same or better

### System Stability
- [ ] No crashes or errors
- [ ] Memory usage stable
- [ ] CPU usage stable
- [ ] Network usage stable
- [ ] Database connections stable

## Rollback Testing
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented
- [ ] Rollback can be executed quickly
- [ ] Rollback restores full functionality
- [ ] No data loss during rollback

## Documentation Testing
- [ ] Implementation plan updated
- [ ] SHIPLOG updated
- [ ] README updated if needed
- [ ] API documentation updated if needed
- [ ] User documentation updated if needed

## Final Validation
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved
- [ ] User experience improved
- [ ] System stability maintained

## Sign-off
- [ ] Developer testing complete
- [ ] Code review complete
